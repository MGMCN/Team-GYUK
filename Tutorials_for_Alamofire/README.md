# Why we use Alamofire
Alamofire provides an elegant and composable interface for HTTP network requests. It does not implement its own HTTP web functionality. Instead, it is built on top of the URL loading system provided by the Foundation framework. In addition, networking in Alamofire (and the URL loading system) is done asynchronously.
